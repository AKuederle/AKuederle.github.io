Don't worry guys! Keep reading! This is really a tech blog! I'm not gonna talk about any kind of world-changing philosophical questions on here! The "I" in the headline simply refers to this blog. So lets talk about why this site is part of the world-wide-web, shall we?

My name is Arne KÃ¼derle and I recently finished by Bachelor's degree in Biophysics. Coding or rather tech in general is a passion of mine for a few years now. However, when learning or keeping up with anything computer related you will end up with a ton of interesting new information. But to be honest, you will forget at least half of the stuff quite fast, if you are not using it on a regular basis. Therefore, I realized I need some kind of "notebook" to save and organize all these little things you would simply forget otherwise. Putting this "notebook" up in the internet for everybody to read, will hopefully force myself to make it more structured and better documented. Furthermore, writing in English will eventually improve my English skills (as you may already noticed, I'm not a native speaker). So the idea of this blog was born.

The blog is divided in two section. First the regular, standard blog section with full length posts, and second the Quicktips, where I collect small tips and snippets of code, which are not worth a full length post. Content-wise I am going to write about what ever topic I'm working on at given time. Usually this is gonna be Windows or Linux related topics on the workflow side of things and Python on the coding site.
