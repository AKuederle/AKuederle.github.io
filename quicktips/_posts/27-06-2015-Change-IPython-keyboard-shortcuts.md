As many programmers who use Python for their scientific work, I really like the IPython notebook interface. However, using a German keyboard, I got annoyed by IPython's hotkeys. Many of them just won't work with a non-US-keyboard-layout. After a while of unsuccessful research about how to change them, the kind response on my [github issue](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/8586) from [Matthias Bussonnier](https://github.com/Carreau), one of IPython's developers, finally got me on the right track. In the following I want to briefly summarize [his documentation](http://carreau.gitbooks.io/jupyter-book/content/keyboardshortcut.html) on this feature and explain how I changed my keyboard shortcuts.

The backend of the IPython notebook, as you probably know, is based on JavaScript. Therefore, the implementation of all IDE features is as well. Knowing JavaScript, you can customize the hell out of your IPython notebook; the only challenge is to find to appropriate commands.

For testing and understanding purposes, I suggest to open a IPython notebook now.

First, we gonna need the list of predefined functions we can create hotkeys for. The easiest way is to run the following lines od code in your browser's JavaScript console ("crtl+shift+J" to open in Chrome and "crtl+shift+K" in Firefox).

{% highlight JavaScript %}
$.map(
     IPython.keyboard_manager.command_shortcuts.actions.\_actions,
     function(k,v){return v}
     )
{% endhighlight %}

This should print out a long list of commands to your console. Fortunately, the names are all self-explanatory. However, this is only a small selection of the available commands, since not all of them are handled by the keyboard_manager. Still, there a some commands I want have new key-bindings for.
To do so, we have to run some more lines of JavaScript. Using the ``%%JavaScript`` cell-magic, we can play with the JavaScript settings directly from inside our notebook.

{% highlight JavaScript %}
%%JavaScript
IPython.keyboard_manager.command_shortcuts.add_shortcut('Shift-k','ipython.move-selected-cell-up')
IPython.keyboard_manager.command_shortcuts.add_shortcut('Shift-j','ipython.move-selected-cell-down')
{% endhighlight %}

So, basically we are just using the provided add_shortcut function to connect a key press with an action.
You can remove a key-bining in the same manner:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
%%JavaScript
IPython.keyboard_manager.command_shortcuts.remove_shortcut('Shift-k')
{% endhighlight %}

As said, we are limited in terms of available functions using this method. The get access to many of the line based commands we have to dig deeper into "Code Mirror", the JavaScript based code editor which powers the notebook. This means, we have to create our own ``actions`` based on its API instead of using predefined ones.

The basic structure of a new command looks like this (example modified from [here](https://github.com/juhasch/IPython-notebook-extensions/blob/master/usability/comment-uncomment.js)):

{% highlight JavaScript %}
'Alt-3' : {
    help    : 'Toggle comments',
    help_index : 'zz',
    handler : function () {
        var cm=IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror;
        var from = cm.getCursor("start"), to = cm.getCursor("end");
        cm.uncomment(from, to) || cm.lineComment(from, to);
        return false;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

So, we start off with the new shortcut ('Alt-3') followed by its assigned attributes. The *help*-parameter helds the tooltip for our new action and the *help_index*-parameter defines the sorting position in the shortcut list (zz = at the end). The real magic happens at the *handler*-parameter; it contains the actual functionality of our shortcut. In the general case (= all examples I saw), the handler is a function and you can literally do what ever JavaScript allows you to do inside it.
Further breaking down the example, in the first line of the function, the currently active Code Mirror instance is called (IPython uses one instance of the code editor for each cell). This instance has a bunch of functions you can call and use. To find out which, we can map and output them in the same way as before using our JavaScript-console.

{% highlight JavaScript %}
$.map(
     IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror,
     function(k,v){return v}
     )
{% endhighlight %}

Using the ``getCursor``, ``uncomment``, and the ``lineComment`` functions, we can create a *toggle-comments*-function as above. Regarding the last line, I'm not sure why the ``return false`` is necessary; in my testing it seems not. But, according to another [guide on this topic](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/adrn/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/User%20Interface.ipynb#Keyboard-shortcut-customization), this line prevents the default action from being executed (again, I'm not a 100 % sure why this is important).

Before we make the created hotkey available inside of our notebook, I quickly gonna show you the other hotkeys I created.

{% highlight JavaScript %}
'Alt-1' : {
    help: 'Indent',
    help_index : 'zz',
    handler: function() {
        var cm=IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror;
        cm.execCommand('indentMore');
        return false;
    }
},

'Alt-2' : {
    help    : 'Indent less',
    help_index : 'zz',
    handler : function () {
        var cm = IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror;
        cm.execCommand('indentLess');
        return false;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you may noticed, these two are not using a provided Code Mirror function directly, but rather the ``execCommand``-function to get access to a even deeper level of [commands](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#commands). Through Code Mirror Addons this list can be extended even further. However, I haven't really looked into it jet and therefore, I'm not sure if you can use addons in combination with IPython (If you no something about it, let me know!).

So, we got our three hotkeys. Now we have to actually add them as shortcuts to our notebook. To do so, we create a variable which contains our shortcuts.

{% highlight JavaScript %}
var add_edit_shortcuts = {
        'Alt-3' : {
            help    : 'Toggle comments',
            help_index : 'zz',
            handler : function () {
                var cm=IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror;
                var from = cm.getCursor("start"), to = cm.getCursor("end");
                cm.uncomment(from, to) || cm.lineComment(from, to);
                return false;
            }
        },

        'Alt-1' : {
            help: 'Indent',
            help_index : 'zz',
            handler: function() {
                var cm=IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror;
                cm.execCommand('indentMore');
                return false;
            }
        },

        'Alt-2' : {
            help    : 'indent less',
            help_index : 'zz',
            handler : function () {
                var cm = IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().code_mirror;
                cm.execCommand('indentLess');
                return false;
            }
        },
    };
{% endhighlight %}

In a final step, we add them to the keyboard_manager:

% highlight JavaScript %}
IPython.keyboard_manager.edit_shortcuts.add_shortcuts(add_edit_shortcuts);
{% endhighlight %}

And we are done; but, only for this notebook. To make our shortcuts available Ã­n every notebook, we have to create an notebook extension. While IPython extensions are .py-files stored in your local /.ipython/extensions folder, notebook extensions are JavaScript files stored in the /.ipython/nbextensions folder. To locate either one of these folders, run ``ipython locate`` from a terminal. Now we just have to create a .js-file containing our shortcut commands. In addition, we gonna add a on-load function, as suggested [here](http://carreau.gitbooks.io/jupyter-book/content/Jsextensions.html#). It looks like this and gives us a nice log-message when our extension is loaded:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
define(function(){
  return {
    // this will be called at extension loading time
    //---
    load_ipython_extension: function(){
        console.log("I have been loaded ! -- custom_shortcuts");
    }
    //---
  };
})
{% endhighlight %}

If you created the file and saved it as "custom_shortcuts.js" inside the nbextensions-folder you should be able to load it from inside of any notebook by running these two lines:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
%%JavaScript
IPython.load_extensions('custom_shortcuts');
{% endhighlight %}

To load the extension automatically when starting a new notebook, open up a IPython notebook and run the following lines:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
%%JavaScript
IPython.notebook.config.update({"custom_shortcuts":true})
{% endhighlight %}

This should update /.ipython/profile_default/nbconfig/notebook.json accordingly. Now your new awesome shortcuts are available everywhere and every time.

As always, you can find the full .js file on [github](https://github.com/AKuederle/IPython-custom-shortcuts/blob/master/custom_shortcuts.js)

I hope you found this little tutorial helpful, and I would really appreciate more input regarding this topic. So, if you happen to know more about IPython's extensions, please leave a comment with resources and suggestions.
