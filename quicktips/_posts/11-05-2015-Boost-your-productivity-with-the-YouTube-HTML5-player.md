I consider online Videos and Audio-media as a very valuable source of information. I listen to podcasts, watch tutorial videos, and expand my common knowledge with help of various science channels on a daily bases. However, watching a two hour podcast, a thirty minute tutorial, and twenty minutes of science videos takes away 2 hours and 40 minutes of your valuable time; This is more than a tenth of a whole day! What if I tell you that you can cut this time by 25 % or even 50 %?

It's easy! Just increase the playback speed of your video, podcast, or whatever type of media your consuming by 20 to 50 %. After a few minutes you get used to the faster talking speed and you saved a few minutes of your valuable time!

So but how to actually do it? Not every media source allows you to easily change the playback speed.

### YouTube

If you are on [YouTube](www.youtube.com), it is easy. You just have to switch to the HTML5-player by visiting this site: [https://www.youtube.com/html5](https://www.youtube.com/html5?gl=DE)
After that, you can change the playback-speed of your video by clicking on the small gear-symbol in the bottom right of the player.

### Any other Source

If you are enjoying your media on any other site, you can utilize the near endless power of the [VLC-Media-Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). You just need to obtain the stream URL somehow. This is usually easily done by right clicking the media object:

However, some services, like [Vimeo](www.vimeo.com), make it somewhat harder for you to get the media URL. But, if you are using the Firefox it is still pretty easy. Just right click the site and select *view page info*; And under the *Media*-Tab you should find an entry with the type *video* or *audio*:

Unfortunately I haven't found a reliable way for all you Chrome users out there. So, if you know one - Leave a comment!

The only thing left to do, is feeding the URL to VLC:

And now you have all powerful playback controls of VLC available for your stream or podcast!
